con_release(src, con)
}

\item{con}{A connection}
}

\description{
\code{con_acquire} gets a connection from a src object; \code{con_release}
returns a previously acquired connection back to its src object. Intended for
internal use.
}
\details{
These methods have default implementations for \code{src_sql} and can be
overridden for src objects that are not themselves DB connections, but know
how to get them (e.g. a connection pool).
